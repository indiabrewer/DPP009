DPP Live Production Exchange Project 

"Traditionally, syndicated feeds for live events have been delivered using costly, managed, cable or satellite feeds. Increasing reliability, security and fault tolerance of IP-based feeds has ensured that distribution using commodity bandwidth is now a viable and cost-effective alternative.

This allows for greater level of automation in the process of acquisition, but there is not currently an agreed method for this process, and the associated commercial considerations, to be carried out.

Live Production Exchange (LPX) is an active DPP project, looking to specify the metadata requirements associated with the publication of these live feeds. The DPP will deliver a minimum viable product to provide the glue between acquisition, distribution and reception points.
